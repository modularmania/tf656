A for-fun project for the 656th Special Operations Task Force. A simple CRUD project for all members, hopefully extending into point values later on.

Once I get everything working, I will hopefully be able to turn it into an actual website that the 656th can use.
Feel free to help out with issues you see, if you are also a programmer! Still working on understanding this stuff by myself without help.
